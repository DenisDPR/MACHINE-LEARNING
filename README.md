# MACHINE LEARNING
You are here to either learn ML or quick view the ML approaches used.I got to ML after rogorous data analysis using python and R.
As I approached different challlenges of data analysis, It was inevitable to apply ML in the kind of datasets, so I had to learn ML.

<br />

Prior to understand ML, one should know atleast some of the following mathematical topics:
i) linear algebra
ii) probability theory
iii) calculus
iv) statistics
v) calculus of variations
vi) graph theory
vii) optimization methods (Lagrange multipliers)

### Other prerequisites:
Knowledge of basic computer science principles and skills, at a level sufficient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program.
- Familiarity with the basic probability theory.
- Familiarity with the basic linear algebra will also do.

## Learning Outcomes:  
This covers a wide range of ML algorithms to solve problem, however,
By the end, you will be able to:
   -Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice of real problems.  
   -Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) , [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification), and [clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).
   -Atleast choose the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.  
   -Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.
   -Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. 
   -Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.
   -Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.
   -Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.  
   -Implement these techniques in Python.
